URL of web application - http://34.73.187.39:8111/

The application allows users to identify all the players on teams and their statistics with the team during the current season, identify players by 
their hometowns, search for players based on conference, sort teams based on year established, which are all capabilities we said would implement in
part one of the project. In addition to these capabilities, we added the capability of looking at team information, their arenas and respective capacities,
search for each player based off of their teams, and the capability to view all cities in the database, and add cities to the database.

Two of the web pages that require the most interesting database operations are the page displaying the cities and the different search pages (http://34.73.187.39:8111/another
and any of http://34.73.187.39:8111/hometown, http://34.73.187.39:8111/conference, or http://34.73.187.39:8111/team respectively). The city page
is interesting because it required us to incorporate a SELECT statement inside of the INSERT statement in order to create a valid primary key for the user defined insertion. 
This statement searches for the maximum primary key (ad_id) and adds one to it in order to create the next valid primary key with each addition to the database.
Then, the redirections bring you to the updated city page, which displays the previous cities and the new city that was added. The different search pages required
us to write SELECT statements, and then incorporate the user defined input so that the outputted table would display the information that the user wished to see,
which had to include preventative measures against SQL injection that could have caused damage to the database. These web pages were interesting because of the 
combination of python, HTML, CSS, and SQL that had to be used in order to produce them. The SQL statements themselves were not overly complex but required knowledge 
of LEFT OUTER JOINS in order to make them straightforward and concise.
